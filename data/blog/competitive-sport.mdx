I shall preface this post by saying that my experiences cannot speak for all people or all sports; I played football, ran some running races, raced downhill ski races and for the most part of my university career rowed at a fairly high level. I learnt an awful lot from my competitive sporting endeavours that helped me succeed in my non-sporting career and think these experiences and insights deserve to be shared with the world, even if they are anecdotal and somewhat subjective.

The health benefits of regular physical exercise are undeniable, in fact, even the Romans were well aware of this: "Mens sana incorpore sano". The physical and psychological benefits are countless; physical exercise improves cardiovascular health, boosts mood & self-esteem, reduces risk of depression, improves sleep quality, reduces risk of chronic diseases and improves body composition. In general, people who exercise regularly (not excessively!) tend to live longer. Advocating for the health benefits of physical exercise wouldn't be a particularly hot take. A lot of people who exercise, exercise without any particular goal or competition in mind and there is nothing wrong with that. Exercising, for many, is a lifestyle choice, that is seen in similar vain to eating a healthy diet. However, in what follows, I want to highlights the merits of competing and illustrate the transferable skills it cherishes.

## Grit and Perseverance
An environment where everything revolves around performance is tough, challenging and humbling. One of the qualities this environment cherishes though is grit, the tenacity to persist in the face of challenges and adversity, a trait that competitive sports cultivate uniquely. 

I actually recall reading about this in a book I read as a teenager; "the Reluctant Fundamentalist" describes the life of Changez, a driven and intelligent man who comes from a middle-class background in Pakistan and moves to the United States to attend Princeton, where he excels academically and is also a star soccer player. Changez goes on to have a successful career in the American corporate world and what accompanies him through this is an unrelenting drive that also carried him to his sporting success, in fact parallels are often drawn in the form of flashbacks.

The development of these qualities stems from the challenging and setback-ridden nature of athletic careers. Pursuing ambitious competitive goals, whether aiming for a personal best, securing a spot on an elite team, or reaching the pinnacle of the Olympics, often requires a long-term commitment. Achieving such lofty objectives necessitates adaptability and unwavering perseverance in the face of setbacks and failures. Two common challenges encountered by high-level athletes include dealing with illness and injury and surmounting performance plateaus. What motivates many athletes is the gradual improvement seen in each training session and achieving personal bests in various performance metrics or indicators. Unfortunately, this journey is unlikely to exhibit a continuous upward trajectory. In rowing for example, these can be rowing machine ergometers output, 1 RM on major lifts, on water time or other metrics like stroke length, total training mileage etc.. although of course, even in rowing, not everything is objective, especially when selecting for team bots. It is nevertheless, refreshing to have an objective sense of one's physiological level.

Although rowing is a fairly data driven sport, the same cannot be said for other sports, particularly team sports and the same can definitely not be applied to the non-sporting world, where it is much more difficult to find similar measures. In the worst-case scenario, your professional career may stagnate, possibly indicated by a lack of promotions, even when your job performance, as measured by objective criteria, has been consistently improving or vice-versa. Nevertheless, there are important lessons that can be learned from dealing with setbacks and stagnation in athletic journeys.

Overcoming setbacks induced by illness or injury as an athlete involves a multi-step process. First and foremost, seeking professional help, ideally from a doctor or physiotherapist experienced in working with elite athletes, is crucial. They will assess the extent of the damage and create a recovery plan with a defined timeline. The next step is a gradual and patient approach to rebuilding. Start by slowly increasing training volume and intensity over an extended period, working towards a full recovery. The duration of this process can vary significantly, ranging from weeks to months, or even years, depending on the severity of the injury or illness. Especially for those facing long-term and severe setbacks, it's common to experience mental challenges. Progress may seem slow, and the athlete may feel far from their previous level of performance. However, barring career-ending injuries, resilient and determined athletes will emerge from this experience, gradually regaining their form. This resurgence can be attributed to the dedication and grit with which they approach their recovery, even if it unfolds over an extended time horizon. 

In one's professional pursuits, facing setbacks induced by health issues, whether they are physical, emotional, or psychological, is a possibility. While these setbacks may not always be directly analogous to athletic injuries, a similar approach can be applied to recover and regain your footing. Just as with athletic setbacks, seeking professional help is a crucial initial step, and then starting gradually is key. For instance, if chronic migraines are impacting your ability to work long hours, consider setting minimalistic goals and gradually increasing your work hours while allowing your body to adapt. Recovery is like walking up a hill, you might make short term progress by going too fast, but you'll eventually roll down to the bottom again. The qualities that help athletes overcome such setbacks can be valuable in these situations as well. Of course, emotional and psychological challenges are diverse and complex, and not all techniques may be universally effective. However, the fundamental principles of seeking professional guidance and taking a gradual, adaptive approach remain applicable and valuable in navigating these professional hurdles.

Plateauing is when an athlete feels stuck and sees no progress in their performance. Despite rigorous training, they aren't getting closer to their long-term goals. This frustrating phase can result from various factors, such as overtraining (excessive training), undertraining (insufficient training), psychological or emotional stress, or ineffective training methods.
A practical way to address this issue is by temporarily stepping back from the current training regimen. It's essential to assess the specific training that occurred leading up to the plateau and consider any external factors that might have contributed to it. This review is vital to refocus on adaptation, as it becomes evident that improvement has come to a halt when measured against objective criteria.

Addressing performance plateaus can have both straightforward and more complex solutions. In some cases, the issue may be as simple as overtraining and an excessively demanding training regimen, leading to performance stagnation. In such situations, reducing training load and taking some time off can pave the way for long-term performance improvement. However, the solution can also be multifaceted, requiring adjustments in training style, plans, and lifestyle choices. The challenge of plateauing isn't limited to sports; it's a common frustration in professional careers as well. For instance, it can manifest as a sense of career stagnation or an inability to drive positive changes within one's professional environment.

Much like athletes dealing with performance plateaus, a valuable approach involves reviewing past actions that have contributed to the current situation. Recognizing the need for change is often a crucial step to overcome perceived hurdles. This change could take various forms, such as changing jobs, switching teams, adjusting work habits, or modifying working hours. Although this process can be arduous and disheartening, it holds immense importance for long-term success. The resilience and dedication to long-term goals developed by elite athletes are equally valuable in the realm of professional endeavors.

A crucial aspect to underscore is the significance of discipline and toughness, qualities that are often undervalued but can be greatly honed through sports. Sport serves as an exceptional teacher in this regard. Toughness comes in various forms: it involves pushing your body to its limits, enduring exhaustion during intense training sessions and throughout weeks of rigorous training blocks. It can also manifest as an unwavering desire to win, closely tied to the ability to physically exert oneself, depending on the nature of the competition and sport. Competitiveness is a driving force that carries athletes through demanding training phases. Few people relish early morning training sessions after a night of inadequate sleep, but those with a burning desire to win will do whatever it takes.

This isn't meant to be a monologue on being excessively tough or a relentless "grinder" like David Goggins; however, being tough, disciplined, and competitive provides a significant edge in any professional pursuit. While working at the limits of your physical capacity in your professional career may not always be the norm and isn't sustainable in the long term, it's valuable to know that the wealth of hard training and competitive experience equips you with the ability to tap into your last reserves of energy when faced with extraordinary situations or immense pressure. This might be in the form of an all-nighter or a similarly demanding effort, allowing you to metaphorically "go the extra mile."


## Periodisation, Pressure and Performance
Sports can be unforgiving, especially at the highest level where months or even years of rigorous training often lead to a single race or match. As an athlete, you must meticulously plan your entire training cycle to achieve peak performance at the exact moment of your key event. While this process is informed by scientific data, especially in endurance and strength events, it also retains an element of artistry. Perfect timing is essential. Reducing your training load (typically a combination of duration and intensity) too much before a competition can cause a loss of fitness, readiness, and premature peaking. Conversely, peaking too late means you only reach your top form after the event has passed.

The stark reality is that training results matter very little in the grand scheme of things. What truly counts is your performance on a specific day at a particular moment in a pinnacle race or event. It's highly unlikely to achieve world-class results without ever achieving anything comparable in training, though not impossible. The critical factor is the performance at that exact instant. Sickness, lack of focus, or simply having a bad day and underperforming can be devastating, but they are an integral part of the reality of being a high-performance athlete. The importance of acute performance is a principle that extends to many endeavours, encompassing numerous aspects of non-sporting careers as well.

A straightforward example is an exam or an interview. In both cases, you want to invest time in studying or preparing and perhaps simulate the conditions of the actual exam or interview by practicing under those circumstances. This principle extends to similar scenarios, such as giving a talk or presentation, getting ready for a crucial business meeting, or comparable events. The most significant similarity between these non-sporting endeavours and competitive sports is their reliance on a specific moment that defines the outcome of what may have been an extended preparation period. Just like in sports, the preparation phase might span weeks, months, or even years, but what ultimately counts is your performance on the day of the exam or during the interview. In a manner similar to a professional athlete who "chokes" and underperforms on the day of their most important event, the same can happen to a student, manager, or engineer who has dedicated countless hours to preparation, conducted excellent dry runs, but then fails to deliver when it truly matters.

It's crucial to recognize that consistently performing at one's absolute best is an impractical expectation, especially when striving to accomplish something challenging and extraordinary. In the world of sports, achieving peak performance every day is an impossibility for several reasons. Physically, it would be incredibly demanding, as periods of rest and reduced training load are necessary for the body to recover. Moreover, it's mentally and psychologically draining to maintain the level of focus and single-mindedness required for peak performance over an extended period of time. Even professional athletes need intermittent periods of relaxation to recharge mentally. Similarly, in the realm of professional performance, the concept of periodization is invaluable. If a single event holds great importance in shaping your future career or the trajectory of your company, similar to an athlete peaking for their Olympic final, you should aim to be at your absolute best during that critical moment. 

However, unlike sports, the professional domain may not involve a physical component, but the mental aspects—being mindful, present, and focused—are elements that can be directly translated from the world of professional sports to non-sporting performance. It's important to remember that if you have a subpar interview, for instance, the interviewers are unlikely to offer much sympathy, even if your past performance has been stellar. The emphasis is on delivering in the present, and adopting the principles of peak performance from sports can significantly enhance your performance in various professional contexts.

Dealing with the pressure of performing when it truly matters is a skill that can be acquired and honed throughout one's athletic career. It doesn't come naturally to most people and can become even more challenging as the level and prestige of events increase over time. I found a few strategies that were particularly helpful in handling pressure during my sporting career. One of the most critical strategies is being brutally honest with oneself about strengths and weaknesses, as well as the level of performance one can reasonably expect at a particular time. Realism in your performance aspirations is key. While it's important not to be delusional about your abilities, it's equally unproductive to be overly pessimistic. Striking the right balance is crucial to manage and evaluate your readiness for performance, enabling you to extract the best from yourself. Ideally, you want to perform at a level just slightly surpassing your past or training output. Attempting to go significantly beyond that is often a risky pursuit that may not pay off in the long run.
Understanding where your strengths and weaknesses lie allows you to concentrate on specific technical aspects that can help you optimize your performance. In a competitive setting, it's advisable to avoid dwelling on the bigger picture and instead focus on the task at hand. Being mindful of your surroundings can be a valuable technique to maintain that focus. Additionally, paying attention to specific technical markers, especially those that directly impact the outcome, is a highly effective strategy. In rowing, for instance, this might involve focusing on body position, the sensations experienced during different parts of the stroke, or the synchronization with your teammates. These specific technical markers can be a powerful tool for staying in the moment and delivering your best performance under pressure.

In non-sporting environments, performance often takes on a different form and tends to be more subjective. Nevertheless, some of the insights gained from sports can still be applied effectively. For instance, becoming distracted by runaway thoughts can be detrimental to an interview or a meeting. Likewise, an accurate assessment of your skills and competence is crucial for success. Focusing on the specific components of a given task and avoiding distractions by dwelling on the future or the past can help manage pressure and allow you to perform at your best. Getting side-tracked or disheartened by memories of past failures should be avoided at all costs. A technique akin to what many athletes employ involves grounding yourself in your surroundings by paying close attention to minor details and sensations. For example, you might focus on a particular pattern on someone's shirt or a distinct smell in the room to help concentrate on the task at hand. Of course, this level of focus should not be so intense that it hinders your ability to respond effectively in an interview or meeting, but it is a helpful technique for maintaining concentration and clearing your mind of intrusive thoughts.

Moreover, having a realistic perspective of your skills and competencies is invaluable. It's often better to undersell yourself than to overstate your competence, which can come across as arrogant and hinder your chances. However, a significant understatement of your abilities may hold you back, preventing you from pursuing opportunities you rightfully deserve. Striking the right balance is essential to present yourself accurately and effectively in professional settings.


## Teamwork
Effective teamwork is of paramount importance in competitive sports, both in team sports and individual sports. In team sports, the significance of effective teamwork is readily apparent. High-performing teams aim to be greater than the sum of their individual parts, utilizing the diversity of skills, talents, and personalities to achieve the best results collectively.

However, even in individual sports like running, cycling, athletics, weightlifting, skiing, and others where only individual performances ultimately count, teamwork still plays a significant role in achieving success. Athletes often collaborate closely with coaches, physiotherapists, sports psychologists, and potentially training partners. Those athletes pursuing exceptionally ambitious competitive goals are highly unlikely to achieve them entirely on their own, especially in well-established sports. The support network and collaborative efforts of these individuals play a crucial role in helping athletes reach their full potential and attain their objectives.

Being a good team player in a competitive sports environment involves several key qualities and behaviours that contribute to team success. Here are some important aspects to consider:

1.	Understanding the Competitive Goal: The best team players have a profound understanding oåf the team's competitive goal. They actively align their actions with this goal and consistently strive to bring out the best in their teammates in the pursuit of it.
2.	Emotional Intelligence: Emotional intelligence is a invaluable trait. It allows athletes to navigate the complex relationships and dynamics within a team effectively. This enables them to focus on what truly matters in the moment and communicate in ways that resonate with their teammates.
3.	Effective Communication: Good team players are adept communicators. They know how to convey their thoughts and ideas clearly, ensuring that their messages are well-received by others. Moreover, they understand the timing of their communication, tailoring their messages to the specific needs of the moment.
4.	Awareness of Time Horizons: Understanding the time horizon within the training and competition cycle is crucial. Effective team players know when to emphasize certain aspects of their performance. For example, sports psychology might be more critical closer to competition, while complex technical adjustments may be better suited for times further from the competition.
5.	Selflessness: Team players prioritize the team's success over individual accomplishments. They recognize that a team wins or loses together, and they take personal responsibility for making changes that contribute to the team's success.
While these points are rooted in the context of competitive sports, they hold relevance in various non-sporting settings. Being able to adapt actions and interactions to maximize the chances of success is a highly transferable skill, applicable in many professional and personal contexts. This ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and align efforts with shared goals is a hallmark of a great team player, both in sports and beyond.

In a manner similar to ambitious sporting pursuits, professional endeavours are often too complex to be accomplished in isolation. It is overwhelmingly likely that almost any job you take up will require a significant amount of teamwork. Whether you work in a large corporation or a small one, whether your job is customer-facing or research-oriented, teamwork is an integral part of most careers. This can involve collaborating effectively with your colleagues within the company, working well with clients, or forming successful partnerships with external collaborators and partners.

Many of the qualities that contribute to success in sports also apply in the professional arena. Those who can bring out the best in those around them tend to thrive in their careers as well. Unlike competitive sports, where the goal is usually well-defined, professional settings often require individuals to define and align with the end goal of their team. Different parties involved may have varying perspectives on what this goal entails, making effective teamwork more challenging. Nevertheless, being an effective communicator and possessing emotional intelligence are valuable attributes that can take you far in your professional journey. They enable individuals to negotiate effectively and work harmoniously with others, leveraging their individual skills and qualities to achieve the team's objectives in the most effective way possible.
