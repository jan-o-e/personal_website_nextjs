summary: 'Competitive sport is not always glorified as a worthwile pursuit for those who seek to have lives that do not centre around competing at the national and international level. Here I seek to disspel this myth. Competing in any sport, to a high level, offers valuable life lessons that can give you an edge in any future pursuit.'
