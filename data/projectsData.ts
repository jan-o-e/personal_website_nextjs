    description: `PayFlow is a payment app which enables crypto payments to recipients who wish to receive fiat currencies. This can be used by merchants, landlords, friends, or anyone with an IBAN willing to receive payments to their bank account from people holding arbitrary ERC20 tokens without ever touching a crypto wallet. We handled the plumbing with fully licensed e-money provider Monerium that allows for a seamless user experience.`,

    title: 'Retrox',
    description: `Retrox originated as an On-Chain Retroactive Public Goods Funding platform at ETH Amsterdam, where it was a finalist prize winning project. We received some small grants and pivoted slightly to work on infrastructure for improving decentralized scientific research and did more of a deep dive into the space. This led to a number of interesting insights and proof of concepts.`,
