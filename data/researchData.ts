    title: 'Quantifying quantum correlations in an analytically solvable many-body systems',
    description: `This research project in quantum information theory aimed to capture how "quantum" many body systems really behave. Fluffy bunny entanglement captures the amount of entanglement (i.e. the "quantum" correlations) which isn't physical and cannot be captured my measurements. Turns out that, if we naively calculate the correlation measures, then the amount of physically accessible entanglement is massively overestimated and there is quite a lot of fluffy bunny entanglement. Remarkably, this can be shown analytically in the system of Harmonium.`,

    title: 'Single photon production with atom-cavity sources',
    description: `Single photons are ubiqutuous in the development of quantum technologies, they are instrumental for quantum networking, metrology and computing. Using photons, quantum information can be transmitted extremely quickly and at low losses with off the shelf optical components. Generating photons on demand, with high efficiency and purity is an open challenge. Another competing demand is the rate at which these photons are generated. Some of my research sheds light on these issues.`,
