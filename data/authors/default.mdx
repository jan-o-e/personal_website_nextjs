I was born and raised in Berlin, but I moved to the UK in 2017 to study Physics and Philosophy, driven by a desire to deeply understand the world. Eventually, I gravitated more towards physics and currently, I am pursuing a quantum physics PhD and working as a Student Investment Partner for CreatorFund. I am particularly fascinated by cutting edge physics research, programming and the development of novel technologies.

Besides that, I love to read, travel and pursue outdoor sports. I spent most of my university career rowing and in my summers and winters I love to surf and ski respectively.
