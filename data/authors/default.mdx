I was born and raised in Berlin before moving to the UK to study Physics and Philosophy. I’ve always been driven by curiosity and wanting to understand how things work at the deepest level and how connections are formed between seemingly disparate topics. That led me to a PhD in quantum optics, where I worked across experiments, simulations, and theory. Along the way, I discovered a real passion for programming and for pushing the edge of what our tools and technologies can do.

I’ve gained experience across a venture firm, a quantum computing startup, and a large tech company, which gave me a broad perspective on how research, technology, and real-world impact intersect.

Outside of work, I love reading, travelling, and being outdoors. I rowed throughout university, and in the summers you’ll usually find me surfing, while winters are for skiing.
